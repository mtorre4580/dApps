# DApps

Decentralized applications that run on a blockchain network or a peer-to-peer (P2P) network

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized platform designed to run smart contracts. It is a distributed computer spread across many nodes around 
the world that executes the code people feed in it, without any possibility of downtime, fraud, censorship, or third party intervention

- The ethereum network is used to transfer money and save data
- The are several networks
- Networks are made up of nodes, where each node is 1 machine
- Each node contains a copy of the blockchain
- Blockchain is a database that keeps the record of each transaction

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts on Ethereum enable us to execute arbitrary computations on the blockchain

## EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine enables the Ethereum blockchain to be programmable. Ethereum Smart Contracts are written 
in high level programming languages like [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/), which have to be compiled down to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code
